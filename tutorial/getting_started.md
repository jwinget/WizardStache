# Getting started

Go to the link provided in Discord (not shared here for security reasons). You should see a login page like this:

![login page image](img/login.png)

Select your character and click "Join Game Session". There is no access key for players.

Once you log in you will likely see a pop-up indicating that the Beyond20 extension is not automatically loaded. In the "addons" area of your browser (to the right of the address bar in Chrome), click the icon that looks like a red d20 with a white `B` inside of it ![Beyond20 extension icon](img/beyond_20_icon.png), and the popup should go away. Click again in the main window to dismiss the Beyond20 pop-up. You are now connected to D&D Beyond.

The overall user interface looks like this (with annotations)

![Annotated UI](img/annotated_ui.PNG)

You can toggle most of the UI off or on by clicking on the anvil in the upper left.

## Basic controls
* Move the map by right-clicking and dragging
* Zoom with the mouse wheel
* Select your token with left-click, when the Player --> selection control is checked ![player select](img/player_select.png)
* Move the selected token with the arrow keys
* Double-click your token to open your character sheet
* Right-click your token to see options
* Target another token by choosing the Player --> target control ![player target](img/player_target.png) and left-clicking the token you wish to target. 4 triangles should appear around it.

## Scenes

The scenes available to you are shown in a bar across the top, just to the right of the anvil. The small colored circle with the first letter of your player name indicates which scene you are currently on. Clicking on one of the scene boxes will take you to that scene.

`Note: you must also have "visibility" in the new scene, either via a token or scene settings. This is controlled by the GM`
